# Make-Build
A simple Makefile to build and install your code.

Taken directly from github.com/MajickTek/QWERTYSH with slight modifications.

## Usage:
Modify the Makefile to fit your build workflow (instructions inside).
Then simply use the command "make all", which runs "make build" and "make install".
To remove the program, type "make uninstall", then "make clean".
