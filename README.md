# Make-Build
A simple Makefile to build and install your code.

Taken directly from github.com/MajickTek/QWERTYSH with slight modifications.

## Usage:
Modify the Makefile to fit your build workflow (instructions inside).
Then simply use the command "make all".
To remove the program, type "make uninstall", then "make clean".

## README
This was modified on my phone on the fly and thus it was not tested.
The original from QWERTYSH had been tested on macOS.
