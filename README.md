# Make-Build
A simple Makefile to build and install your code.

Taken directly from github.com/MajickTek/QWERTYSH with slight modifications.

## Usage:
Modify the Makefile to fit your build workflow (instructions inside).
Then use the command "make build", and "make install" in that order.
To remove the program, type "make uninstall", then "make clean".
